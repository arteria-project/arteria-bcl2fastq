Try running it:

     python ./bcl2fastq/app.py --config config/bcl2fastq.config.yaml

    http://localhost:8888/api/1.0

Install:
    # install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # install the bcl2fastq_ws package and create the script bcl2fastq-ws
    python setup.py install

    # TODO This is not working yet.
    # install the daemon, after this you can manage the service through
    # etc/init.d/bcl2fastq-ws
    install-daemon

Running integration tests in docker container (with a centos base):

    # NB: The container currently builds of an internal image.
    #     We will work to find some publically available data,
    #     to base of, but this is it for now.
    docker build -t bcl2fastq-ws .
    docker run -v $PWD:/bcl2fastq-ws -p 8888:8888 -t -i bcl2fastq-ws:latest /bin/bash

    # Once inside the docker container execute
    cd /bcl2fastq-ws/ && pip install -r requirements.txt && python2.7 setup.py install && python2.7 bcl2fastq/app.py --config config/bcl2fastq.integration_tests.config.yaml
